# Slither AI

![Screenshot](/screenshots/screenshot.png)

We are building an AI for [slither.io](slither.io), a multiplayer snake game.
We want our bot to be able to play above-average and reach the leaderboards. Currently, our AI uses a combination of gathering food and avoiding enemies to
survive for a reasonable amount of time, on occasion reaching scores of 2000+.
